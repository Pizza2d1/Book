# Book
A better version of first_baby that has more functions, uses classes, and has better documentation

#TO RUN THIS PROGRAM YOU MUST SELECT "book_with_class.py" NOT "book_class.py", THE LATTER IS NOT MEANT TO BE RUN

THIS CREATES TWO NEW TEXT FILES ON YOUR COMPUTER: filecode.txt and a1lockedbook.txt

Expanded idea of journaltest.py to have a navigatable journal/book that allows you to search day, month, year, and iteration.
Need to add a more friendly user interface that works in both python terminals and making the program more concise (less but bigger functions?), maybe add a function that reads filecode.txt and put its data in global variables so read() and write() dont have to manually do it, dates have finally been added which was a pain in the butt, I might do another setting that changes (month/day/year) to (hour:minute \t day/month).
