# Book
A better version of first_baby that has more functions, uses classes, and has better documentation

#TO RUN THIS PROGRAM YOU MUST SELECT "better_book.py" NOT "book_class.py", THE LATTER IS NOT MEANT TO BE RUN

THIS CREATES TWO NEW TEXT FILES ON YOUR COMPUTER: filecode.txt and a1lockedbook.txt

Expanded idea of journaltest.py to have a navigatable journal/book that allows you to search day, month, year, and iteration.

#Things I need to work on:

Need to add a more friendly user interface and making the program more concise (less but bigger functions?), being able to search iterations based on a range of dates rather than a small portion that I think could be improved, I might do another setting that changes (month/day/year) to (hour:minute \t day/month) (Scratch that, that was a fucking stupid idea and I will not do that, what would even be the use?). Makes user profiles that have specific perms to either only their interations or all iterations as an admin (why? just have it in different folders, it'll still work)
